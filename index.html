                        Dear Steve, As much as I was a strong believer in using Windows everywhere for any reason, I have to admit, I have been converted. I own a MacBook and I absolutely love it. I've owned several iPods, and now, I am very glad to own an iPhone 4. Personally, I think the iPhone 4 is the most innovative technology out. The way it feels in your hand, the slimness, all the way down to how rugged it is, yet classy. Your inspiration will be missed, and that sincere smile you have when sharing your creation with the world will be remembered. I always looked forward to the Keynote presentations you would lead and the new and amazing technology that was presented in the show. Thank you for your innovation and your amazing mind. No matter what people told you, you always seemed to say to them "It can be done". <br /><br />

                        A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him Personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel. <br /><br />

                        Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company, I can't find words how to describe my feelings.... For me, Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he"ll be remembered around the world as a genius. <br /> <br />
